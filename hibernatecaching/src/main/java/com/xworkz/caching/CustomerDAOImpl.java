	 * Database caching is nothing but a data is stored in a buffered memory.
	 * for the data which we demand again n again to reduce the number of DB calls.
	 * 
	 * Hibernate provides first level cache with session objects.
	 * it uses memory rather than hitting DB.
	 * for the first time after hitting the DB, it caches the results in cache memory
	 * in both first-level and second-level cache
	 * as session1 and session2 are two different sessions
	 * after closing session1, session2 fired a query to get the customer
	 * if we didn't close session1 then hibernate won't fire any query 
	 * rather it uses a same result from cached data for id 1.
	 * 
	 * first-level cache is enabled by default, we cannot disable that 
	 * the entity object will remain in the cache until session is open 
	 * once the session is closed, associated cache is cleared.
	 * if my session object is long lived, fetching large amount of data will leads
	 * to out of memory error
	 * 
	 * second - level cache
	 * default it is disabled, developer needs to enable it
	 * SessionFactory is responsible for second-level cache
	 * This cache data is available for the entire application
	 * once the session factory is closed then cached data is removed
	 * 
	 * Use session.evict(entityObject) to remove cached data.
	 * 
	 * (session/session-factory) are objects in a heap area. That means the cache is stored in 
	 * the RAM only. And because of that, it gives faster access to data rather than databases.
